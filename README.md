## Angular Personal Organizer

### Angular Personal Organizer is a powerful app programmed using the MEAN stack - MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node. It uses directives, controllers, routes and a service to manage all data within the application. 

### The App enables the users to create new tasks, by entering a task name and selecting a due date, and save them into the database. It is also possible to view a list of all tasks ordered by date, where the user can tick the tasks as "completed", edit the information or delete the item.
